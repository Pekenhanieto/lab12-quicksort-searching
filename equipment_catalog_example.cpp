/*
 * Analysis Answers
 *
 * B4 - Partition and recursive control
 * After the first partition, identify the pivot code, its returned index, and
 * the two next ranges. Is the whole catalog already sorted? Explain using data.
 * Answer:
 *
 * B5 - A search that fails
 * Trace the recursive search for code 36. List each first, last, middle,
 * inspected code, and next range. At the empty range, explain which calls resume
 * and how -1 reaches main without an invalid array access.
